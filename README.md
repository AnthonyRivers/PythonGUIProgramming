# PythonGUIProgramming
Repo to keep track of my progress from the Burkhard Meier Lynda course on GUI programming with Python.

## Overview
The course covers how to create effective graphic user interfaces with Python.
- Course starts by showing how to create a form, add widgets, manage the resulting layout, and customize look and feel.
- Continues with making charts with Matplotlib, work with data, and classes.
- Next the course covers how threading and networking impact the performance of the code. 
- Then databases, testing GUI applications, extending a GUI with wxPython library, and creating 3D GUIs uisng PyOpenGL and Pyglet is cover.

The course covers the follwoing topics:
* Creating buttons and widgets
* Adding labels and features
* Expanding a GUI dynamically
* Aligning frames and embedding frames
* Creating menu bars, message boxes, and tooltips
* Using module-level global variables
* Coding in classes
* Using Matplotlib to create charts
* Working with multiple threads, queues, and TCP/IP
* Using URLOpen to read data from websites
* Localizing a GUI and preparing for internationalization
* Testing a GUI using unit tests and Eclipse PyDev IDE
* Using the wxPython library
* Using Tkinter, PyOpenGL, and Pyglet
